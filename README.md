# Supprocom.OpenSimplexNoise

`Supprocom.OpenSimplexNoise` supplies deterministic OpenSimplex Noise for C#.
The public `OpenSimplexNoise` type evaluates two-dimensional, three-dimensional,
and four-dimensional coordinates.

The parameterless constructor uses the current clock value as its seed. The
`OpenSimplexNoise(long seed)` constructor gives the same output for the same seed.
These compatibility constructors allocate managed arrays.

## Installation

Use this command to install version 0.1.1.

```shell
dotnet add package Supprocom.OpenSimplexNoise --version 0.1.1
```

## Example

```csharp
using Supprocom.OpenSimplexNoise;

var noise = new OpenSimplexNoise(123456);
var height = noise.Evaluate(12.5, -4.25);
var density = noise.Evaluate(12.5, -4.25, 8.0);
var sample = noise.Evaluate(12.5, -4.25, 8.0, 0.5);
```

## Allocation-free state

Use the static API when the sampling boundary cannot allocate managed memory.
The caller owns four permutation tables and one source scratch buffer. Each
buffer must contain at least 256 bytes, and the buffers must not overlap.

```csharp
using Supprocom.OpenSimplexNoise;

Span<byte> permutation = stackalloc byte[OpenSimplexNoise.PermutationTableLength];
Span<byte> permutation2D = stackalloc byte[OpenSimplexNoise.PermutationTableLength];
Span<byte> permutation3D = stackalloc byte[OpenSimplexNoise.PermutationTableLength];
Span<byte> permutation4D = stackalloc byte[OpenSimplexNoise.PermutationTableLength];
Span<byte> sourceScratch = stackalloc byte[OpenSimplexNoise.SourceScratchLength];

OpenSimplexNoise.Initialize(
    123456,
    permutation,
    permutation2D,
    permutation3D,
    permutation4D,
    sourceScratch);

var height = OpenSimplexNoise.Evaluate(permutation, permutation2D, 12.5, -4.25);
var density = OpenSimplexNoise.Evaluate(permutation, permutation3D, 12.5, -4.25, 8.0);
var sample = OpenSimplexNoise.Evaluate(permutation, permutation4D, 12.5, -4.25, 8.0, 0.5);
```

Initialization writes all five buffers. The source scratch buffer is not
required during evaluation. Successful initialization and evaluation do not
allocate managed memory.

Package tests compare exact output bits with the published version 0.1.0 output.
The tests include zero, negative, large, epsilon, and finite double-limit inputs.
They also measure managed allocations for initialization and evaluation.
